Win + S ==> Execution Policy ==> PowerShell ==> Change execution policy...

OR

Win + R ==> ms-settings:developers ==> PowerShell ==> Change execution policy...

OR

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force

OR

"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoLogo -NoProfile -Command "& {Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force}"

Last one is fastest solution: execute PowerShell command from BAT script!

RemoteSigned:
Purpose: Requires that all scripts and configuration files downloaded from the internet be signed by a trusted publisher before they can be run.
Security Level: Provides a medium level of security by preventing the execution of scripts from untrusted sources.
Use Case: Suitable for environments where you want to allow local scripts to run but prevent unauthorized scripts downloaded from the internet.
Behavior:
    Local scripts (created on your machine) can run without a signature.
    Scripts downloaded from the internet need to be digitally signed by a trusted publisher.
    This helps prevent untrusted scripts from running and potentially harming your system.

Bypass:
Purpose: Allows all scripts to run without any prompting or restrictions.
Security Level: Provides the lowest level of security as it completely bypasses execution policy checking.
Use Case: Suitable for test environments or scenarios where you need to run any script without restrictions (use with caution).
Behavior:
    All scripts run without any checks or prompts.
    No restrictions on script execution whether local or downloaded.
    This can be a significant security risk if used on a production system.

DO NOT DELETE. Use ImDisk to save TEMP vars configuration to REG file for use with AIM Toolkit.

The installer is able to recreate all the required services and all the ramdisks if the configuration is written to the registry.
To get the required registry values, go to the General Settings panel and click on the "Save Parameters..." button.

General Settings ==> Save Parameters... (with TEMP Environment Variables) ==> Save As (*.reg)

Size: 10GB
Allocation: Dynamic
Letter: R
Label: RamDisk
FS: NTFS
TEMP Folder: Yes
TEMP RELOCATE Env Vars: Yes
TEMP RELOCATE Junction: No (Some soft can't access TEMP folder)

Known issues:
    - CAN'T RELIABLE START ON WIN11 (SOMETIMES CREATES UN-ACCESSABLE DISK WITHOUT FORMATTING).
    - Dynamic ramdisks do not work properly when they are mounted on a folder instead of a drive letter, and if you don't use the TRIM commands (TRIM commands are used by default with NTFS on Windows 7 and later).
    - Some softwares are incompatible with ImDisk volumes. This comes from the driver that creates only simple volumes that are not handled by the disk manager. This will not be fixed.
    - Some users experience issues with Windows Update. If you have volumes mounted on A: or B:, try to move them after C:. If a ramdisk contains the Temp folder, using a junction may also fix issues (see "Set TEMP Variables...").
